# Requirements Elicitation

## What do you want us to make?
A simple, personal CRM application. This application should be web-based.

## Who will be using the application?
I will be using the application.

## Why do you want to use the application?
I want to keep track of my contacts' details, especially those who I meet for the first time or don't get to meet often.

## What features do you want it to have?

### Authentication
I want to be able to register a new account, and log in/out of those accounts. A new user would register using their email address and password. There is no need for a user profile, but you can store the user's name to add some personalisation to the overall experience. The security of the application is highly critical, considering that it is storing contacts' personal information.

### Detailed contacts profile
I want to be able to create new contacts. Each contact needs to store many personal details, notably: name, gender, email, phone number, relationship, first contact timestamp, their assigned group, and additional notes. These information should be populated into a table. It would be great if I can upload a photo to a contact, but it is not required. Lastly, I want the ability to directly assign a contact into a group upon its creation.

### Contacts page
I want to see a list of contacts that displays representative information on each contact. I don't need to see any group memberships here. Upon tapping a contact, I want to see their personal details. I also want to be able to search for a contact by their name here. It would be great if you can search for contacts on other keys, but it is not required.

### Contact groups
I want to classify my contacts into user-created groups. A group does not need to store any other details other than its name and members. Additionally, one user can only belong to one group at a time. If the user tries to violate this constraint, an error pop-up should be displayed. Lastly, I want the ability to directly add existing contacts into groups upon the creation of a group.

### Groups page
I want to see all the contact groups that I have. On tapping a group, I want to see a list of said group's members along with their representative information. Tapping a contact in this list should also display the contact's personal details. Lastly, I want a 'Show All Groups' button when navigating away from the group list that takes me back to the main Groups page.

### Dashboard
I want to see an overview of my knowledge base, notably the number of contacts and groups that I have. From here, I should be able to navigate to the contacts or groups page as necessary. It would be great if I can search my contacts from this page, but it is not required.

### Event memos
In the dashboard, I also want to see memos pertaining to some event/task. These memos should be store a title and additional notes. Note that these are memos and not to-dos, so there is no need for them to be tick-off-able. The last five memos can be displayed in a list in the dashboard, represented by their titles. It would be nice if you can display these memos within a calendar instead, but it is not required. Tapping any of the memos should display its details. Lastly, I want the ability to navigate to a Memos page by tapping the Memos header.

## What do you want it to look like?
I want the UI to be simple, clear, and incorporate the color blue (preferably pastel). You can look at [Circles](https://www.zoowho.com/) to get an idea of what I want the app to look like.

## How will communications be held from this point on?
We will definitely meet three more times throughout the course of this semester after each of your sprints. Otherwise, you can contact me via your Slack channel for any additional arrangements.

## Do you have a handover date in mind?
Nope. We will see how your sprints progress throughout this semester, and follow the general timeline set by your subject.
