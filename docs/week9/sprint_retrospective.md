# Sprint 1 restrospective

## Summary

> What went well in the Sprint

Overall the team had good collaboration, everyone is responsive when contacted. Everyone in the team has been hold accountable to what they plan to do and has completed their work on time. Additionally, it is flexible to arrange meeting between each other. It has been a huge advantage as this weekly meeting gives an idea on what everyone is doing.

In the backend team, we have adhered to initial standards and standards were established before implementation. By standardising from the start, it helps guide them to the controller function that needs to be done.

In the frontend team, we have helped each other out to learn deeper into React Typescript. The frontend team has divided the job making it clear on what each other does.

> What could be improved

More communication between the frontend and the backend team regarding the progress of each other. In the past we have been working in seperate silos, moving forward we plan to communicate better. This would be achieved by having more communication in Slack; updating each other when they start, plan to finish, and finish some specific task. We also plan to arrange another weekly meeting with the team internally to show the progress of each member (not only talking in stand ups).

> How do you feel the entire sprint process\

The members mostly enjoy the workload that was given. Some just picked up react and had some learning curve, however the members help each other out and guide each other to create the product we know today. On the other hand, some members feel the anxiety that the work might not be done as there were lacking of updates in communication.

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

Everyone agrees that they feel the most joy when their code finally works.

## Dyno Wibowo

> What went well in the Sprint\

    - The backend team had a great workflow. Every controller function was already well defined from the start of the project; giving a clear description of the inputs and outputs).
    - Having a weekly stand-up meeting which helps update the team members on what each other do.

> What could be improved

    - Could create a different avenue aside from the stand-up to show each others work.
    - Decide early on the structure for testing files as it was annoying to restructure them midway of the process.

> How do you feel the entire sprint process

    - The learning curve was not too steep as the members did help a lot, especially Nathanael with his code sample.
    - It was not too stressful, even though there was a mild struggle, it was still bearable.
    - Workload was manageable, 3-4 hours a week.

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

    - Enjoyed it well as it went smoother than my previous project.
    - Finishing JEST test file is a joy as it was complicated to work through it.

## Joshua Situwali

> What went well in the Sprint

    - The workload between the members were clear on what everyone do and when it needs to be done.
    - Learning curve into React Typescript was not too steep, as the members help each other.

> What could be improved

    - More communication between the frontend team on what the end goal and thought process of each other.

> How do you feel the entire sprint process

    - There was a lot of learning however, the workload was not too demanding.
    - It was a struggle to coordinate with the difference of timezone between the members.

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

    - It was interesting as I have learned a lot of new knowledge (React Typescript, Axios, HTML, CSS).
    - Quite overwhelmed	learning as we have decided to code in Typescript which does not have a lot of documentation online.
    - Taking four subjects in addition to the learning curve was quite stressful.

## Livya Riany

> What went well in the Sprint

    - Every team member knew what their doing on the week and everyone did it on time.
    - Collaboration with the frontend team was quite okay, as the members understand React quite quickly.
    - The documentation that the backend team was really helpful in the creation of API; reduce of opening 3 individual files (router, controller, models) into just one file.

> What could be improved

    - Coordinate better and voice the end goal to the team, so everyone know where we are heading. Currently its just, dividing workload equally between each other each week but not in the same page on where we are heading.
    - More communication in Slack between the frontend and backend team.
    - Update Trello often and chat with the members on each others progress.

> How do you feel the entire sprint process

    - It was okay as learning curve was very little and the documentation the backend team provided was super helpful.
    - Some regrets with mismatched expectations between the frontend team.

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

    - The job was distributed quite well.
    - Every member was responsive and helpful when asked for help or responsibility on what they have created on.
    - Really enjoyed learning new things such as creating a hamburger navigation bar and utilising local storage.

## Nathanael Putro

> What went well in the Sprint

    - The backend team has adhered to initial standards well and had good communication.
    - The workload between the members were distributed fairly.
    - Having a weekly meeting, helps gives clear idea on what everyone is trying to do.

> What could be improved

    - Improve code standards.
    - Have a JEST test that is more comprehensive.
    - There was an abject lack of communication between frontend and backend. This can be solved by having a seperate scheduled meeting to explain what everyone do.
    - Trello is not enough to keep everyone updated. Therefore, everyone should chat on Slack on the progress they had throughout the week.
    - Review documentation between the members faster as documents could have mistakes.

> How do you feel the entire sprint process

    - In my opinion my workload was normal however, the others ended up not getting enough or equal tasks. It made it look like I did too much work.
    - The first 3 weeks of the sprint was alright however on week 4 it has been quite stressful merging the frontend and backend side.
    - There was a regret that the standards was not established to the best of out interest from the start. Nobody raised the fact that it needs to be improved until the last minute.
    - Anxiety as the product manager, due to the lack of updates from the members (not knowing how everyone progress throughout the week, needing to wait until the weekly meeting to know what everyone do)

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

    - Tremendously enjoyed the process compared to the previous subject that I have taken.
    - Felt that I relaxed too much.
    - Was really happy that deployment went really smoothly.

## Stanley Wirian

> What went well in the Sprint

    - By standardising from the start, it helps guide them to the controller function that needs to be done. During implementation helped to not thinking of what needed to be done but how it should be done.
    - Typescript and JEST setup was amazingly organised.
    - Communication is okay, the team replied very quickly and helpful. Additionally, we are friends in real life therefore its easy to communicate with each other without feeling reluctant. Knowing each other, adds a degree of trust between members for doing their job well.
    - The API documentation was very neat and organised.

> What could be improved

    - The frontend team should have commit earlier, more often, merge to main frequently.
    - More communication from the frontend in Slack.
    - Improve the coding standards by standardising it.

> How do you feel the entire sprint process

    - The first half of the project were fine but the second half its when there was a struggle. Spent 5 days straight day until night trying to solve the risk condition issue.
    - There was a feeling of shocked and disappointment that by week 4 the sprint was not done yet even-though I have foreseen this.
    - It was satisfying when JEST and CI pass.

> How much do you enjoy the entire process

    - It was a joy seeing the code I wrote works in postman.
    - Writing a failed JEST test, going back to postman finding the problem, fixing it, and JEST worked perfectly.
    - Seeing CI and JEST pass one by one is very satisfying and thrilling.
    - Talking to the team is fun and enjoyable too.
